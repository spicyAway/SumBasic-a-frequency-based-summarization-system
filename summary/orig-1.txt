Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene is stepping down at the end of the year. Like Diane Greene, Kurian has serious enterprise chops, Koenig said. Diane Greene, who was hired three years ago to build Google's cloud-computing business, is being replaced in that job by former Oracle executive Thomas Kurian. "When I joined Google full-time to run Cloud in December 2015, I told my family and friends that it would be for two years," Greene wrote. Greene, a director of Google parent company Alphabet since 2012, is staying on the board. We revamped customer engineering and added a team of experts in the Office of the CTO.
