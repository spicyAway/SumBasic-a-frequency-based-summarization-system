Diane Greene, who was hired three years ago to build Google's cloud-computing business, is being replaced in that job by former Oracle executive Thomas Kurian. Google said on Friday that Kurian is joining Google Cloud on Nov. 26 and will take over the leadership role in early 2019. It's been a rocky tenure for Greene, who brought serious enterprise chops to Google, having previously co-founded and run VMware. Greene, a director of Google parent company Alphabet since 2012, is staying on the board. Kurian spent more than two decades at Oracle, rising to the level of president of product development.
