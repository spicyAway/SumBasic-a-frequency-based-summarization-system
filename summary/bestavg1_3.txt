Greene has served as chief executive of Google Cloud; Kurian will be senior vice president for Google Cloud, a company spokesman said. Google clearly remains serious about scaling up its enterprise business. Greene said she had joined Google three years ago with plans to leave after two years and will move into investing and philanthropy in January. She will remain on Alphabets board. Google also bowed out from bidding for a $10 billion military cloud computing contract, citing its lack of certifications to handle sensitive data. Greene responded by announcing the deal would not be renewed. Steve Koenig, a financial analyst following Oracle for Wedbush Securities, said Kurian is better positioned at Google to drive business sales growth than at his former employer.
