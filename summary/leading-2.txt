TORONTO -- Canada's privacy commissioner is planning to issue guidance for buyers and sellers of legal cannabis amid ongoing concern about potential fallout, such as being barred from the United States, if transactions become known by third parties. The concern has been heightened in provinces where anonymously paying cash in-store is not possible in light of a controversial Statistics Canada initiative to obtain detailed bank records from all Canadians. "Our office recognizes the sensitive nature of cannabis-related transactions -- particularly if information about those transactions is processed in a jurisdiction where cannabis consumption is not legal," said Tobi Cohen, a spokeswoman for the federal privacy commissioner.
