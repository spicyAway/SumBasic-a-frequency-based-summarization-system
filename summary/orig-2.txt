However, a spokeswoman for the Ontario Cannabis Store said such an approach doesn't fly. The process of getting a sales licence from Health Canada is onerous, according to Durkacz. Meantime, Rebecca Ambrose, owner of the Vancouver Seed Bank, which is not government licensed, said her sales for October have at least tripled, with many Canadians ordering her banks illicit seeds online because they have no legal option. But licensed producers say they are focused on meeting Canadas massive demand for ready-to-consume products first. Sometimes these goals conflict and compete with each other.The only near-term solution to the supply shortage, according to Durkacz at FSD Pharma, is to allow retailers to sell product sourced from the black market.You would instantaneously have a supply-demand balance and then you could try to convert people from the black market to the legalized market, he said.
